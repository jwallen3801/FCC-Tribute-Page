        <h3 id="headline">Some highlights from the life of this mad musical genius:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1940</strong> - Frank Vincent Zappa is born in Baltimore, Maryland.</li>
          <li><strong>1950s</strong> - Due to frequent moves brought on by his father's work as a defense industry chemist, Zappa attends various high schools, where he joins his first band and develops a strong interest in music, particularly blues, doo-wop, and modernist composers Igor Stravinsky and Edgard Verese. By the time he graduates in 1958, he teaches himself music composition by spending long hours in the library and obsessively listening to records, eventually writing and conducting original pieces of music for the school orchestra.</li>
          <li><strong>1963</strong> - A young Frank Zappa appears on Steve Allen's syndicated late night show, demonstrating the use of a bicycle as a musical instrument.<br>

          <li><strong>1965</strong> - While making a living as a producer at an independent recording company, Zappa is arrested and briefly imprisoned on questionable pornography charges. The incident leaves a permanent mark, contributing to his lifelong contempt for authority and censorship.</li>
          <li><strong>1966</strong> - Zappa has his first mainstream success with his band The Mothers of Invention. The band's debut album <em>Freak Out!</em>, a broad satire of American society and the burgeoning hippie movement, showcases an eclectic range of musical styles and earns him a devoted fanbase in the United States and Europe. The Mothers would continue to release innovative rock albums throughout the 60s and 70s, garnering attention for their elaborate live shows.</li>
          <li><strong>1967</strong> - Zappa marries Adelaide Gail Sloatman, who he met the year before during the promotion for <em>Freak Out!</em>. The two remain married for the rest of his life, and Gail is left in charge of his estate after his death. Their first child, daughter Moon Unit Zappa, is born. As a teenager, Moon would appear on her father's hit 1982 single "Valley Girl".</li>
          <li><strong>1969</strong> - Frank and Gail's second child, son Dweezil Zappa, is born. Dweezil would later become a musician as well, releasing his first single at age 12 and appearing on a number of his father's recordings. Years after Frank's death, Dweezil would go on to become something of an evangelist for his father's musical legacy, touring from 2006 onward to perform his music with a rotating lineup of musicians, consisting largely of Frank's former bandmates, under the name Zappa Plays Zappa.</li>
          <li><strong>1971</strong> - While performing at the Casino de Montreux in Switzerland, a flare set off by an audience member ignites a fire that burns down the casino and destroys tens of thousands of dollars' worth of the band's equipment. The incident is later immortalized in the Deep Purple song "Smoke on the Water". A week later, another crazed audience member attacks Zappa during a show, pushing him off the stage and nearly killing him. The incident leaves him wheelchair-bound for months and permanently damages his larynx, forcing him to sing in a lower register for the rest of his career.</li>
          <li><strong>1974</strong> - Frank and Gail's third child, son Ahmet Emuukha Rodan Zappa, is born. Frank begins to find success as a solo artist with albums such as <em>Apostrophe (')</em>.
          <li><strong>1976</strong> - In December, Zappa and his band perform on season two of <em>Saturday Night Live</em> with guest vocals performed by <em>SNL</em> announcer Don Pardo, culminatng in a series of Christmas shows featuring Pardo and members of the <em>SNL</em> band at the Palladium in New York City, later released as a double live album titled <em>Zappa in New York</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>1979</strong> - Frank and Gail's fourth child, Diva Muffin Zappa, is born. After founding his own label, Zappa Records, he releases the two most commercially successful albums of his career: the double album <em>Sheik Yerbouti</em> and the rock opera <em>Joe's Garage</em>. He also releases the film <em>Baby Snakes</em>, a combination of stop-motion animation and live concert footage.</li>
          <li><strong>1985-1986</strong> - Following a trend throughout the '80s of becoming increasingly outspoken about his political views, Zappa begins making high-profile public appearances as an anti-censorship advocate. In 1985, he testifies before the U.S. Senate to voice his opposition to the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), a committee formed by the wives of several prominent politicians to promote content advisory warnings on music deemed to have violent, drug-related, and/or sexual themes. He also makes several appearances on CNN's <em>Crossfire</em> to debate conservative pundits on topics such as free speech, the First Amendment, censorship, parenting, and the role of religion in government.

          </li>
          <li><strong>1990</strong> - Zappa is diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer, possibly caused by exposure during his childhood to dangerous materials brought home from work by his father. (Zappa was also a heavy smoker.) The same year, he visits Czechoslovakia at the request of President VÃ¡clav Havel, a longtime admirer. Havel designates him as Czechoslovakia's "Special Ambassador to the West on Trade, Culture and Tourism".</li>
          <li><strong>1993</strong> - Frank Zappa dies at the age of 52, at his home with his wife and children by his side.</li>
