As one of the required projects for Responsive Web Design certification at freeCodeCamp, I was asked to make a simple tribute page with some biographical information about any real or fictional person to demonstrate basic competency in HTML and CSS. Since I've been listening to a lot of Frank Zappa albums while I've been learning to code for the past month, it seemed like a natural choice. I'm starting to feel pretty comfortable with HTML, but this is my first time really doing anything with CSS, so please keep that in mind if you happen to see this.
